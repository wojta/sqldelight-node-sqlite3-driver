# sqldelight-node-sqlite3-driver 
Driver for the library [SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) that supports [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) Node.js module
* example here: https://github.com/wojta/example-sqldelight-node-sqlite3-driver

## [API KDoc](https://wojta.github.io/sqldelight-node-sqlite3-driver/)

## Gradle set up 

Pretty much it's almost the same as with https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/2.0.0-rc01/js_sqlite/

Initialization of SQLDelight is needed

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("js") version "1.8.0" // probably would work even with different one
    id("app.cash.sqldelight") version "2.0.0-rc01" // for version 0.2.0
}
፧
፧
፧
sqldelight {
    databases {
        create("Database") {
            packageName.set("com.example")
            generateAsync.set(true) // required for this driver!
        }
    }
}
```

Add dependency to the driver:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    js {
        binaries.executable()
        nodejs {
            dependencies {
                implementation("cz.sazel.sqldelight:node-sqlite3-driver-js:0.2.0")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You'll also need to install binary bindings for SQLite3. This can be done by adding a special Gradle task that runs yarn
in the `sqlite3` node package directory.

```kotlin
val bindingsInstall = tasks.register("sqlite3BindingsInstall") {
    doLast {
        val sqlite3moduleDir = rootProject.buildDir.resolve("js/node_modules/sqlite3")
        if (!sqlite3moduleDir.resolve("lib/binding").exists()) {
            exec {
                workingDir = sqlite3moduleDir
                val commandLine = "${yarn.yarnSetupTaskProvider.get().destination.absolutePath}/bin/yarn"
                commandLine(commandLine)
            }
        }
    }
}.get()
tasks["kotlinNpmInstall"].finalizedBy(bindingsInstall)
```

## Simple example



Queries are written as here - https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/2.0.0-rc01/js_sqlite/


```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    val driver = initSqlite3SqlDriver(filename = "test.db", schema = Database.Schema)

    val database = Database(driver)

    val playerQueries: PlayerQueries = database.playerQueries

    println(playerQueries.selectAll().executeSuspendingAsList())
    // Prints [HockeyPlayer(15, "Ryan Getzlaf")]

    playerQueries.insert(player_number = 10, full_name = "Corey Perry")
    println(playerQueries.selectAll().executeSuspendingAsList())
    // Prints [HockeyPlayer(15, "Ryan Getzlaf"), HockeyPlayer(10, "Corey Perry")]

    val player = HockeyPlayer(20, "Ronald McDonald")
    playerQueries.insertFullPlayerObject(player)
}
```

Note: Please use `executeSuspendingAsList()` in queries instead of `executeAsList()` as that API is not suspending and will throw an exception with this driver.


## Thanks
To _Isuru Rajapakse_ and the project [KStore](https://github.com/xxfast/KStore) which is an inspiration for the set-up of publishing in Gradle scripts. 

To authors of SQLDelight, implementation is based on the [sqljs](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/) implementation of the driver which is already included in the library.s.
